Instead of buying one I decided to build one using an Arduino an IR sensor and a bit of hacking. It turned out okay, I would say.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nI have stuck an IR sensor to my KWH meter, this sensor bounces IR light off the wheel in the sensor and measures the amount of reflected light. Code on the Arduino interprets the signal and times the time between passages of the black stripe. It also sends the data to Xively through an ethernet interface.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
